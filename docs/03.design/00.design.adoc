= Building Block Design

[NOTE]
.Content Description
================================
This section contains:

* A concise breakdown of the Building Block in several independent services (when applicable). For each component, the following subsections are added:
** Overview and purpose: indicating the functionality covered by the component
** SW Reuse and Dependencies: indicating reuse of third party open source solutions (if any) and any pre-required Dependencies
** Interfaces: both internal to the building block and those exposed externally
** Data: Data usage of the building block, data flow and any GDPR concerns should be addressed here
** Applicable Resources: links and references to (Reference Docs), and repositories.

When a breakdown is necessary, a general overview of the building block can be given. On the contrary, no breakdown indicates a single component development with the same expected sections.

================================

== Authentication and Authorization Service

The login service provides both authentication and authorization via it's oxAuth component. This component also provides the OpenID Connect (OIDC) and UMA flows, exposed through endpoints to external clients.

The login service provides administration functionality for users with elevated priviledges. This allows admins to have an overview of the entire system, as well as configure anything necessary from this interface.

Examples of what can be configured here are:

- Oauth Clients
- UMA Scopes & Resources
- Edit/Add/Remove Users
- ... and many more

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

- **oxTrust**: A gluu component, providing the web interface and interaction
- **opendj**: The instance of LDAP providing the backend store for information
